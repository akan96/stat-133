Relation between number of reviews and rating
```{r}

#new business table with necessary variables
business <- business %>% 
select(city, review_count, stars, categories, neighborhoods, business_id) %>% 
filter(grepl("Restaurants", categories)) %>%
mutate(neighborhoods = gsub("^\\[u'|'\\]$|^\\[\\]$", "",neighborhoods),
categories = gsub("'|^\\[|\\]$|","",categories), 
categories = gsub("^u","",categories), 
categories = gsub(", u", "," ,categories))
```

```{r}
#simple plot about number of reviews and rating
ggplot(business, aes(stars, review_count)) + geom_jitter() +
geom_smooth(method = "loess", se=T) + 
geom_hline(yintercept = 2000) + geom_hline(yintercept = 1000)
```
It turns out that most restaurant have fewer than 1000 reviews. Few have more than 2000, very few have more than 4000 numbers of reviews. 

```{r}
#Examine restaurants that have more than 2000 and 1000 reviews
above2000 <- business %>% filter(review_count>2000)
above1000 <- business %>% filter(review_count>1000)
#count
n2000 <- above2000 %>% nrow()
n1000 <- above1000 %>% nrow()
n2000
n1000
```

```{r}
#common identity explore - city
city2000 <- above2000 %>% filter(city=="Las Vegas") %>% nrow() %>% print()
city1000 <- above1000 %>% filter(city=="Las Vegas") %>% nrow() %>% print()
```
All restaurants with over 2000 reviews locate in Las Vegas. 
Majority of restaurants with over 1000 reviews locate in Las Vegas

```{r}
#common identity explore - stars
stars2000 <- above2000 %>% group_by(stars) %>% summarise(count=n()) %>% print()
stars1000 <- above1000 %>% group_by(stars) %>% summarise(count=n()) %>% print()
```
For restaurant that have lots of reviews, four-star restaurants usually have more reviews than other star level. 

```{r}
#restaurants under 1000 reviews
under1000 <- business %>% filter(review_count<1000)
ggplot(under1000, aes(stars, review_count)) + geom_jitter() +
geom_smooth(method = "loess", se=T)
```
It is clear that there does not exist a linear relationship between number of views and stars. Instead, four star restaurants are more likely to have more reivews; or restaurants that have more reviews are not necessarily better. 

```{r}
#Explore different cities
#select cities with more than 1000 restaurants
selectcity <- under1000 %>% 
group_by(city) %>% 
summarise(total=n()) %>% 
filter(total>1000) %>% 
print()
```

```{r}
select_city <- under1000 %>% 
filter(city %in% c("Edinburgh","Scottsdale", "Montreal", "Pittsburgh", "Charlotte","Phoenix", "Las Vegas"))
ggplot(select_city, aes(stars, review_count)) +
geom_jitter(size=0.4) +
geom_smooth(method = "loess", se=T) +
facet_wrap(~city)
```

There are two situations. Either restaurants with four stars get more reviews, or people write reviews to all restaurants.
